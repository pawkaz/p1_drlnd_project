# Project 2: Continuous Control

### Introduction

This repository contains a solution for the second project from the Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning Program. The agent has solved the task in ```147 episodes```. The best achieved score is equal to ```35.56``` for the version 2 of the environment.

### Environment

![Trained Agent][image1]

In this environment, a double-jointed arm can move to target locations. A reward of +0.1 is provided for each step that the agent's hand is in the goal location. Thus, the goal of your agent is to maintain its position at the target location for as many time steps as possible.

The observation space consists of 33 variables corresponding to position, rotation, velocity, and angular velocities of the arm. Each action is a vector with four numbers, corresponding to torque applicable to two joints. Every entry in the action vector should be a number between -1 and 1. The environment is considered as solved when an agent is able to receive an average reward (over 100 episodes, and over all 20 agents) of at least +30.


### Setting up the environment

1. Download the environment from one of the links below.  You need only select the environment that matches your operating system:

    - **_Version 1: One (1) Agent_**

        - Windows (64-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/Reacher_Windows_x86_64.zip)
    
    (_For Windows users_) Check out [this link](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/827218/how-to-determine-whether-a-computer-is-running-a-32-bit-version-or-64) if you need help with determining if your computer is running a 32-bit version or 64-bit version of the Windows operating system.

   

2. Place the file in the repository, and unzip (or decompress) the file. 

### Train model
To train the agent, run in the terminal:

```bash
python train.py --path  <environment path>
```


You should see a result similar to one of the following.
Notice that, you will be notified when the enviornment is solved. The best models are saved according to the mean score over 100 consecutive episodes in the files ```checkpoint_actor.pt``` and ```checkpoint_critic.pt```.
